# stock-recommender-backend
The backend for a project which allows a user to input 5 stocks, and recommends which stocks to buy based off of the 50 vs 200 day moving average. The code for this project can be found in the index.js file. This backend works by retrieving the price data for the last 200 days from the marketstack.com API, finding the 50 and 200 day averages, and recommending the stock if the 50 day average is greater than the 200 day average.
